              been widely applied in various fields. There is a lack of research, however,
              that demonstrates empirically how users benefit from the increased size and
              resolution afforded by emerging technologies. We designed a controlled
              experiment to evaluate the individual and combined effects of display size and
              resolution on task performance in an Information-Rich Virtual Environment
              (IRVE). We also explored how a wayfinding aid would facilitate spatial
              information acquisition and mental map construction when users worked with
              various displays. We found that users were most effective at performing IRVE
              search and comparison tasks on large high-resolution displays. In addition,
              users working with large displays became less reliant on wayfinding aids to form
              spatial knowledge. We discuss the impact of these results on the design and
              presentation of IRVEs, the choice of displays for particular applications, and
              future work to extend our findings.},
